# ![logo](./images/logoSoC38.png) School of Code's precourse challenge: Tribute page.
This is my very first project created with html and css before begining the 16-week bootcamp at the School of Code in November 2021.
## Introduction.

I decided to create a tribute page about the honey bees because I am concerned about the environment and I love nature. I think honey bees need more attention due to the big impact they have in our society and most of us we are not aware of that.

In this project, I put together all the knowledge I have learnt so far in a short period of time starting from a zero knowledge of coding. I have to confess that I did not spent as much time working in this project as I wanted because of my former work, and also because I had the opportunity to see my family in Spain since the pandemic started. I could not help it!

I am now back in England, and I was thinking, 
>_if I was able to make some time to learn to code when I was busy, what will I be able to achieve now that I resign my job to get into tech industry?_ 

I am really excited and looking forward to seeing what I can do in 16-week time.

## Installation.
You just need to clone this repository and create a project directory. After that, execute the html file that you will find in your directory.

## Project status.
I intentionally decided do not to keep working on this project because I wanted to use it as a reflection on my learning path since I began to learn to code. It gives me an insight into how much I improved my skills and a sense of achievement.
