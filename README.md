>I decided to create a tribute page about the honey bees because I am concerned about the environment and I love nature. I think honey bees need more attention due to the big impact they have in our society and most of us we are not aware of that.
In this project, I put together all the knowledge I have learnt so far in a short period of time. I have to confess that I did not spent as much time working in this project as I wanted because of my former work, and also because I had the opportunity to see my family in Spain since the pandemic started. I could not help it!
I am now back in England, and I was thinking, _if I was able to make some time to learn to code when I was busy, what will I be able to achieve now that I resign my job to get into tech industry?_ I am really excited and looking forward to seeing what I can do.
