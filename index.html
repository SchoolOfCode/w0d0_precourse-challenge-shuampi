    <p>Almost 90% of wild plants and 75% of leading global crops depend on animal pollination. Honey bees alone are responsible for approximately 80% of worldwide pollination. Of around 100 crop species, honeybees pollinate 70, including fruits, vegetables and nuts.</p>
   <article id="tribute-info"><p>The best known honey bee is the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination; the only other domesticated bee is the eastern honey bee (Apis cerana), which occurs in South Asia. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, and have been kept by humans for that purpose, including the stingless bees, but only members of the genus Apis are true honey bees.</p>
     <h2>Types of bee in a colony.</h2>
       <p>In any hive there are three types of honey bee: a single queen; thousands of female worker bees and, in the summer, hundreds of male drones. The drone bee does no work and in the early autumn they are evicted by the workers and die.</p>
     <h2>Economy impact.</h2>
     <p>Bees are crucial to our economy – without them it would cost UK farmers £1.8 billion a year to pollinate our crops. In a world without bees, our food would cost a lot more to produce and our economy would suffer.</p>
     <h2>Healthy environment.</h2>
    <p>Whether you find them charming or annoying, bees are incredibly important. They pollinate plants in gardens, parks and the wider countryside, including more than three-quarters of the UK’s wildflowers.

Flourishing nature and healthy animal populations are a sign of how healthy our environment is.</p>
    <h2> Endangered bee species.</h2>
    <p>Since 1900, the UK has lost 13 species of bee, and a further 35 are considered under threat of extinction. None are protected by law. Across Europe nearly 1 in 10 wild bee species face extinction.</p>
     <h2>Bee decline.</h2>
    <p>We already know enough to do something to help, even if some issues might need more research to be fully understood. There's now overwhelming scientific evidence that neonicotinoids harm bees. Neonicotinoids are a group of a group of pesticides commonly used in UK farming. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) declared in 2013 that they posed an “unacceptable risk” to bees, leading to temporary restrictions. And in April 2018 countries across the European Union – including the UK – voted to ban the outdoor use of 3 bee-harming pesticides. </p> 
     <h2>You can help</h2>
    <p>You can make a huge difference where you live by doing a few simple things.

Planting flowers rich in nectar will really help bees find the food they need. Choosing local, British honey will lend your support to our honey bees and their beekeepers. Encouraging your friends and neighbours to do the same will help create bee-friendly communities.

Bees are crucial in the countryside but they’re essential in the city too. A wild window box in the middle of the urban jungle has great value. A whole building covered in window boxes is even more useful and looks fantastic.</p>

    <p>“Human beings have fabricated the illusion that in the 21st century they have the technological prowess to be independent of nature. Bees underline the reality that we are more, not less, dependent on nature’s services in a world of close to 7 billion people”

- Achim Steiner,
      Executive Director UN Environment Programme (UNEP)</p></div>
